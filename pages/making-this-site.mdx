# The making of this site
<br />

This is the 3rd time I've rebuilt this site...

<br />I originally built this thing when I was about to finish my diploma - I
needed something to help me land a job. It was a single page site with the
typical projects and skills sutff, it looked quite nice and definitely helped me
land a job.
<br />      

I'm apparently easily bored and regularly feel the need to change things up - my
theme, font or a cool new plugin to help "productivity". I also dislike my code pretty soon after writing it, which is kinda becoming a problem... 
<br />          

I think this could be bad because instead of moving on and creating/working on projects I just spend time re-doing, already done things. On the other hand I suppose I'm learning how to do things better each time?
<br />

## The 1st iteration
The original site was a CRA (create react app) with Typescript. It was a single page scrolling site - very typical of a new developers portfolio site. I wasn't the biggest fan of this site, partly becasue the code was terrible but mainly because this was not the aesthetic I wanted for my site. I was just ticking off the checkboxes for a portfolio site. After settling in to the industry I was keen to rebuild it.
<br /> 
## The 2nd iteration
The 2nd time I built this site was supposed to be the last... oops. I used html5, css3, vanilla js and php. I thought this would be more impressive than using a framework and show off some underlying knowledge. I built a dynamic client with a very basic admin/cms to add new blocks of text to the homepage and to create new blogs. // more to come here. This however proved a little problematic due to two main issues. 
<br />  

**One:** Routing to individual blog posts. This was an issue as my solution to having dynamic/unique urls for each blog was to pass the id along with some query params to the api and render it on the server. I didn't love this as I really wanted to keep the view, in the view... Also I like the domain name I have once rerouted to the server, it was the ugly free-teir url provided by Heroku. What a segue into two.
<br />
**Two:** Using a free teir database/server. This was easily the most painful part of the site
