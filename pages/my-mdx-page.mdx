# The making of this site

This is the 3rd time I've rebuilt this site...

<br />I originally built this thing when I was about to finish my diploma - I
needed something to help me land a job. It was a single page site with the
typical projects and skills sutff, it looked quite nice and definitelt helped me
land a job.
<br />
I'm apparently easily bored and regularly feel the need to change things up - my
theme, font or a cool new plugin to help "productivity". I also dislike my code pretty soon after writing it, which is kinda becoming a problem...
