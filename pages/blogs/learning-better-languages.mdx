This is a bit of hot topic but it really shouldn't be.

<br />

The languages I am most familiar with are Typescript, Javascript and PHP. Two of these are loosely typed and one is not (hopefully).

<br />

At work I've used a lot vanilla JS & PHP... And so have others. The code base is quite large (~10yr project) and so I have know been exposed to what a lot of loosely typed code looks like. My conclusion so far is - how do these languages even get selected for professional projects that will exist for multiple years.

<br />

Fistly, I know that with good practices and some tlc a decently *clean* codebase can be written in JS or PHP. However, most companies or people don't have this luxury. There are small teams moving quickly, inexperienced devs (me) and a boatload of other things that could contribute to this.

<br />

The problem is for most cases it feels like the large and messy codebase is almost inevitable. One day you open your editor to fix a bug, the bug lives within a ~70 line fucntion that takes several params (all without types) and you need to do something like... 

<br />

``` 
function demo(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5) {
  console.log([
    "potenital prob 1", param1,
    "potenital prob 2", param2,
    "potenital prob 3", param3,
    "potenital prob 4", param4,
    "potenital prob 5", param5,
  ]);
  // code 
}

``` 
<br />

I'll also quickly mention that to see this console.log you might have to go through several annoying steps to execute the code. And yes I know this is obviously some poor code - but god damn if this isn't the world we live in.

<br />

So when you finally find the bug, it's because param1 is typically an array of strings (string[]) but in this case it was just a string. There is some code in the function that calls .splice() on the array when a condition is met. Ahhh crap...

<br />

So if this was .ts instead - in this very cherry picked example, we never would even run the faulty code. Lets continue with the example.

<br />

What if the code is all working correctly, param1 is only ever passed string[] and there is no bug. Lets say there is a new dev in still in their onbaording and one of the very first tickets they are assigned is to go into this function and //cont
