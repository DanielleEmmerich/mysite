This is a bit of hot topic but it really shouldn't be.

<br />

The languages I am most familiar with are Typescript, Javascript and PHP. Two of these are loosely typed and one is not (hopefully).

<br />

At work I've used a lot vanilla JS & PHP... And so have others. The code base is quite large (~10yr project) and so I have know been exposed to what a lot of loosely typed code looks like. My conclusion so far is - how do these languages even get selected for professional projects that will exist for multiple years.

<br />

Fistly, I know that with good practices and some tlc a decently *clean* codebase can be written in JS or PHP. However, most companies or people don't have this luxury. There are small teams moving quickly, inexperienced devs (me) and a boatload of other things that could contribute to this.

<br />

The problem is for most cases it feels like the large and messy codebase is almost inevitable. One day you open your editor to fix a bug, the bug lives within a ~70 line fucntion that takes several params (all without types) and you need to do something like... 

<br />

``` 
function demo(
  param1, 
  param2, 
  param3,   
  param4, 
  param5
) {
  console.log([
    "potenital prob 1", param1,
    "potenital prob 2", param2,
    "potenital prob 3", param3,
    "potenital prob 4", param4,
    "potenital prob 5", param5,
  ]);
  // code 
} 
``` 

<br />

I'll also quickly mention that to see this console.log you might have to go through several annoying steps to execute the code. And yes I know this is obviously some poor code - but god damn if this isn't the world we live in.

<br />

So when you finally find the bug, it's because param1 is typically an array of strings (string[]) but in this case it was just a string. There is some code in the function that calls .splice() on the array when a condition is met. Ahhh crap...

<br />

So if this was .ts instead - in this very cherry picked example, we never would even run the faulty code. Lets continue with the example.

<br />

What if the code is all working correctly, param1 is only ever passed string[] and there is no bug. Lets say there is a new dev in still in their onbaording and one of the very first tickets they are assigned is to go into this code and add some new functionality. 

<br />

The new dev needs to go in and add a users last name initial to the end of the firstname on the client side of stuff.

<br />

They head into the code and after some digging around find said function. Currently with no idea of what any of these parms mean or do. They are using console.log on all of them trying to figure out how to execute the statement.

<br />

You could find out via the network tab or checking the api controller that sends the data but that probably isn't your first thought and shouldn't need to be done for something like this. 

<br />

Now imagine we are in .ts land... The new dev finds the correct file, maybe they find the interface first - with a complete list of all properties. Maybe they find the function first and using the lsp can type 'param1.' and see all the suggestions.

<br /> 

Maybe they also find param1: any[]. Unlucky.

<br /> 

I know this is a rather basic example but it does causes breaking bugs in prod and also just an creates annoying dev experience. 

<br />

Not knowing types is starting to become such a strange concept for me. Being unable to know what type specific methods I can and can not run on a value is just silly, and why until runtime to find out.

<br />

Moving on from Typescript and the land of "const some_var: any". I'm currently learning Rust and really enjoying it, however slow this process may be.

<br />

I am very new to this language and definitely am nowhere near competent. Even still, so ealry into the learning I can see what all the fuss is about. Currently I have not had Rust code compile and not work, I also have only had one or two times where the lsp has not picked up something that would not allow compilation.

<br />

The language is so strict but in such a refreshing way - You will never be confused about types or what is allowed and what isn't. I also cannot help but to think this must reduce technical debt.

<br />

For a very basic example we have something like this: 

<br />

``` 
const addNumbers(value_one, value_two) {
  return value_two + value_one;
}

```

<br />

The problem here is you might do this:

<br />

```
const val = 5;
const other_val = "10";
addNumbers(val, other_val);
```

<br />

Now this might be accidental because the server sent the value 10 as a string for whatever reason. But the language says "all good, lovely code there mate"... And now you have returned "510" instead of 15.

<br />

If this were Golang or Rust we would not have been able to make such an annoying error. 

<br />

```
fn addNumbers(value_one: i32, value_two: i32) -> i32 {
  return value_one + value_two;
}

let val = 5;
let other_val = "10";

addNumbers(val, other_val); // mismatched types - expected i32 and found str
```

<br />
  
To summarise I'm having a blast with types and learning Rust - I am struggling to see why so many people/projects are choosing to use weakly typed languages. 

<br />

I know speed is likely the determining factor (developer speed, definitely not language speed) but boy does that truth flip on its head later into the project.

<br />

In saying that I am big fan of JS and PHP - they have lead the way for everything web, but it may be time we look to some alternatives.
