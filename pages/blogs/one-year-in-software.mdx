I've just recently hit the one year mark of being a professional software developer.   

<br />

A year in any industry is not a lot, but in software it feels kinda funny. You start off knowing nothing and being *very* aware of it. Then you hit 5-6 months and think - "this whole software thing is easy".

<br />

And that is such a hilarious thought to have because it is anything but easy.

<br />
 
One of the things you have to battle when being a new dev is your attitude. This seems like an easy thing but I've worked for many years before this and consider myself to be quite good in this regard. 
  
<br />
 
It's so easy in software to judge yourself by your intentions and others by their actions. You start to see the ~ 10 year old codebase and you can't help but to critisie it. 

<br />

You find yourself questioning everything without giving respect to the people and the position they were in when the decision was made. I've come to realise this happens to a lot of people for a few reasons.
